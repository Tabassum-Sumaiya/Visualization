# Dashboard for Sales and Service 

## Data

Used Automative data which is provided by IBM cognos.

## Sales Dashboard

First of all, I used template that has 4 small rectangles at the top and a large rectangle below. Then rename the dashboard tab to Sales.

Capture the following KPI metrics as visualizations:

1. On the Sales dashboard, capture the following KPI metrics:

1. In the first small rectangle (Panel 1), capture Profit (formatted to 1 decimal place in millions of US dollars).
2. In the second small rectangle (Panel 2), capture Quantity sold.
3. In the third small rectangle (Panel 3), capture Quantity sold by model (as a bar chart).
4. In the fourth small rectangle (Panel 4), capture Average quantity sold.

2. On the Sales dashboard in the large rectangle (Panel 5), display ‘Profit’ by ‘Dealer ID’ as a column chart, sorted in ascending order.

#### Tools : use Cognos Analytics for cleaning, analyzing and also for visualization.

## Service Dashboard

Here, I used the 2 x 2 rectangle areas tabbed template & rename the dashboard tab to Service.

On the Service dashboard, capture the following KPI metrics as visualizations:

1. In the top left area (Panel 1), capture the number of recalls per model of car (as a column chart).
2. In the top right area (Panel 2), capture the customer sentiment by comparing positive, neutral, and negative reviews (as a treemap).
3. In the bottom left area (Panel 3), capture the quantity of cars sold per month compared to the profit (as a line and column chart).
4. In the bottom right area (Panel 4), capture the number of recalls by model and affected system (as a heat map). This will help us understand if there are any outliers for a given model or a specific system.
